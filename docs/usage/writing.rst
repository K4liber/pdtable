Writing
=======

Use the aptly named ``write_csv()`` and ``write_excel()`` to write to files as well as to text streams.

Letâ€™s write the tables we read earlier to a text stream.

>>> from pdtable import write_csv 
>>> with StringIO() as s:
...     write_csv(tables, s)
...     print(s.getvalue())
...
